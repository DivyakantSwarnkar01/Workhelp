# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# **Firebase**

We are required to Install Firebase Javascript SDK because we are using firebase databases to retrive data.

In Node following command used:

==> "**npm install firebase**" as per need of users.

# TailwindCSS

We are also using TailwindCSS library for designing our webapp beautifully.

npm can be runned to install tailwindcss in our whole complete WebApp, like:

==> "**npm install tailwindCSS@version**" and a slight modification sometimes required in Vite.config file to take up all changes from TailwindCSS point of view.
